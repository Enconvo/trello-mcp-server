# Trello MCP Server - Active Context

## Current Work

We are building a Trello MCP Server that provides tools for interacting with the Trello API through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The server is based on the Generic MCP Server Template and has been customized to work with Trello.

## Recent Changes

1. Created tool handler files for all Trello resources:
   - `board-tool-handlers.ts`
   - `list-tool-handlers.ts`
   - `card-tool-handlers.ts`
   - `member-tool-handlers.ts`
   - `label-tool-handlers.ts`
   - `checklist-tool-handlers.ts`
   - `trello-tool-handlers.ts` (combines all handlers)

2. Updated the main server file (`index.ts`) to use the Trello tools and services.

3. Updated the configuration (`config.ts`) to include Trello API key and token.

4. Created a `.env` file with the actual Trello API credentials.

5. Updated the README.md and package.json to reflect the new project name and purpose.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test the server with actual Trello API calls to ensure all tools work correctly.

2. **Documentation**: Add more detailed documentation for each tool, including examples of how to use them.

3. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for specific Trello API errors.

4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to avoid hitting Trello API limits.

5. **Authentication Improvements**: Add support for OAuth authentication to make it easier for users to connect their Trello accounts.

6. **Additional Tools**: Consider adding more specialized tools for specific Trello workflows.

## Current Status

1. âœ… Fixed TypeScript errors in the index.ts file:
   - Added type assertion for toolName when accessing trelloToolHandlers
   - Modified error handling in base-service.ts to avoid adding properties to AxiosError

2. âœ… Successfully built and ran the server
   - Server is now running and ready to handle MCP requests
   - Updated welcome message to be Trello-specific

3. âœ… Fixed API_KEY configuration issue:
   - Added API_KEY to .env file
   - Added API_KEY to Claude Desktop configuration file
   - Server now successfully connects to Claude Desktop

4. ðŸ”„ Still need to test all tool handlers to ensure they work correctly with the Trello API.
