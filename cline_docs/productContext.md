# Trello MCP Server - Product Context

## Purpose

The Trello MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for interacting with the Trello API. It allows AI assistants to perform operations on Trello boards, lists, cards, and other resources through a standardized interface.

## Problems Solved

1. **Trello Integration for AI Assistants**: Enables AI assistants to interact with Trello directly, allowing them to manage tasks, projects, and workflows.

2. **Comprehensive API Coverage**: Provides a complete set of tools for all major Trello operations, eliminating the need for users to implement these integrations themselves.

3. **Type Safety and Error Handling**: Ensures reliable interactions with the Trello API through robust error handling and type safety.

4. **Simplified Authentication**: Handles Trello API authentication, making it easier for users to connect their Trello accounts.

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: The server uses a Trello API key and token to authenticate requests to the Trello API.

2. **Service Layer**: A set of service classes handle the communication with the Trello API, providing methods for all major operations.

3. **Tool Definitions**: MCP tools are defined with clear schemas, descriptions, and input validation.

4. **Tool Handlers**: Handlers implement the logic for each tool, using the service layer to interact with the Trello API.

5. **MCP Server**: The server exposes the tools to AI assistants through the Model Context Protocol.
